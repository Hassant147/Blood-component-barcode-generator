# Blood-component-barcode-generator

Two versions of the same barcode preview tool:

1. `tool-free.html` – free edition (only *Red Cells in Additive Solution, LD*). Includes instructions, unlock messaging, and links in the bottom-left.
2. `tool.html` – paid edition (full catalogue) with the same UI, plus the modal preview + zoom controls.

**Usage**
- Open either file in a browser and fill the donation number, blood group, product, and expiry date.
- Click **Generate**, then **Download PNG** to save the label.
- Click **Open large preview** to view the modal, zoom in/out, and inspect the barcode details.
- The free footer reminds the user how to unlock the full list and who to contact for help.

Only PNG export is provided now; the older SVG download button was removed as requested.
